      "3. **Scattering**: When sunlight hits these molecules, it scatters in all directions. This scattering effect is more pronounced for shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) than longer wavelengths (like red and orange).\n",
      "4. **Blue dominance**: As a result of this scattering, the shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) are distributed throughout the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from all directions.\n",
      "5. **Our perception**: Our brains perceive this scattered blue light as the color of the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the sky appears blue because the shorter wavelengths of sunlight are scattered by the tiny molecules in the atmosphere, making them more visible to our eyes.\n",

      "\n",
      "* The exact shade of blue can vary depending on atmospheric conditions, such as pollution levels, dust particles, and water vapor.\n",
      "* During sunrise and sunset, the sky often takes on hues of red, orange, and pink due to a different scattering effect involving longer wavelengths of light.\n",

      "Based on the provided Virginia code sections (§ 22.1-296.1 and § 22.1-307), it appears that having a violent felony conviction may disqualify you from becoming a teacher in Virginia. According to Section B, no school board shall employ any individual who has been convicted of any violent felony set forth in the definition of barrier crime (§ 19.2-392.02) or any offense involving the sexual molestation, physical or sexual abuse, or rape of a child.\n",
