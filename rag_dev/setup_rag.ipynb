      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh. It's a process that occurs when sunlight interacts with tiny molecules of gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's what happens:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters these small gas molecules.\n",
      "2. The shorter, blue wavelengths of light are scattered more than the longer, red wavelengths by the tiny molecules. This is because the smaller molecules are more effective at scattering shorter wavelengths of light.\n",
      "3. As a result, the blue light is dispersed in all directions and reaches our eyes from all parts of the sky.\n",
      "4. Meanwhile, the longer, redder wavelengths continue to travel in a straight line, reaching our eyes only when they're overhead, which is why the sun often appears yellow or orange due to these longer wavelengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, when we look at the sky, we see the blue light that's been scattered in all directions, giving it its characteristic blue hue. This effect is more pronounced during the daytime, as the sun is higher in the sky and there are fewer particles in the air to scatter the light. At sunrise and sunset, when the sun is lower, the light has to travel longer distances through the atmosphere, which scatters even more of the shorter wavelengths, making the sky appear more orange or red.\n",
